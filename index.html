<h1>My First Open Source Contribution</h1>
<p>I am following an <a href="https://twitter.com/denicmarko/status/1522876362377338880">awesome tweet</a> by Marko Denic encouraging his Web Development followers to make their first open source contributions. I have followed the step-by-step guide provided in a link on the tweet. This code is part of Step 6 in the guide.</p>
<p>I think Marko's guide skipped a step after cloning the repository in Step 3. I think we should change to the newly created directory, <blockquote><code>cd git-demo</code></blockquote> before Step 4.</p>
